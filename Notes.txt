ADDING COLOR TO THE RANDOMLY GENERATED PIXELS

    draw_indexed() is a way to draw primitives in an indexed order.
    In this case the primitive is GL_TRIANGLES.
    The GL_TRIANGLES object requires at least one piece of information:
    the coordinates of the primitive's vertices.

    The vertex information is based on 2 things: v2i, v meaning vertext information,
    and 2 for the number of components per vertex (meaning 2D space).
    The data supplied is of type i (integer).

    Optionally, you can supply color information to the GL_TRIANGLES object.
    This instructs the rendering process what color each corner should be mapped
    against. There is a similar definition: c3B, where c is for color, 3 means
    3 items per data blob (RGB in this case), and the data is of type B (unsigned int).
    The color is tied to each vertex specified earlier in v2i, so if you have 4
    vertex coordinates, you'll need 4 color pairs.

    You need to multiply your color definition, which is randomly generated for each cell
    using random.randint(), by as many times as you have corners. Your color definition
    will look like (255, 255, 255). You can find the number of corners with
    int(len(square_coords)/2). The /2 is because there are 2 pairs per corner in
    square_coords, but you only want to count the amount of corners, not positions.
